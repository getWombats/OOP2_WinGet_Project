<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->
## About The Project

More or less simple Application with UI for using winget Package Installer.
Instead of opening PowerShell or Prompt and type every command, the goal is to have a UI which is easy to use.

This project is intended to implement the contents of the course IN212 "object oriented programming 2".

### The Application is built with

* [![JavaFX][JavaFX]][JavaFX-url]

<!-- PROJECT CONDITIONS -->
## Project terms of reference

- a) Create at least four unit tests that check important parts of your application logic

- b) Enumeration type with Enum

- c) Use at least three of the following techniques: Inheritance, casting, interfaces, abstract classes or generics.

- d) Collections and sorting

- e) Certain data should be serialized or stored by the user (e.g. with Java serialization / without external DB), so that they are still available after restarting the application.

- f) Use the possibilities of exceptions purposefully, in order to handle exceptions in your application cleanly. Make sure that an error can be analyzed in detail with the help of log data.

- g) The project should be delivered as a Maven project and can be generated via the build process of Maven. An already compiled and directly executable version of the program should also be included in the delivery. Use packages to structure your classes according to a chosen architecture approach.
