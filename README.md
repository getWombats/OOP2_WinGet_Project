- b) Enumeration type with Enum

- c) Use at least three of the following techniques: Inheritance, casting, interfaces, abstract classes or generics.

- d) Collections and sorting

- e) Certain data should be serialized or stored by the user (e.g. with Java serialization / without external DB), so that they are still available after restarting the application.

- f) Use the possibilities of exceptions purposefully, in order to handle exceptions in your application cleanly. Make sure that an error can be analyzed in detail with the help of log data.
